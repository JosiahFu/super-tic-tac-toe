## Rules (Wikipedia)

> Each small 3 × 3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the
> larger 3 × 3 board is referred to as the global board.
>
> The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots.
> This move "sends" their opponent to its relative location. For example, if X
> played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next
> in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any
> one of the nine available spots in that local board, each move sending X to a
> different local board.
> 
> If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal
> tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a victory for the player
> in the global board. Once a local board is won by a player or it is filled
> completely, no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to
> such a board, then that player may play in any other board. Game play ends when
> either a player wins the global board or there are no legal moves remaining, in
> which case the game is a draw.
